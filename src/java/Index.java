   *    - Implement the self balancing AVL tree
   *
   *  {@link Q19}
   *    - You are given a list of numbers 1 -> n
   *      One of the integers is missing in the list. Write an efficient code to find the missing integer.
   *
   *  {@link Q20}
   *    - Get the kth element form the end of a linked list.
   *
   *  {@link Q21}
   *    - A list of n string, each of length n, is sorted into lexicographic order using the
   *      merge-sort algorithm. (TODO)
   *
   *  {@link Q22}
   *    - Find a triplet a, b, c such that a^2 = b^2 + c^2. Variations of this problem like find a
   *    triplet with sum equal to 0. Find a pair with given sum. All such questions are efficiently
   *    solved using hashing.
   *    - Rotate a matrix by 90 degree. (FIXME)
   *
   *  {@link Q23}
   *    - Reverse a linked list in groups of size k.
   *
   *  {@link Q24}
   *    - Implement a stack with push(), pop() and min() in O(1) time.
